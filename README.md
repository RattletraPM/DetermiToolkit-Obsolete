#== IMPORTANT ==
These old scripts were part of previous versions of DetermiToolkit/UDTranslationKit and were designed to be used with Undertale
v1.00. Since Toby doesn't use the SFXCAB file format anymore, THEY SHOULDN'T BE NEEDED TO EDIT UNDERTALE v1.001.
As such, I won't be updating them anymore and I'm including them here just for historic purposes (or in case you need them
for any reason).
